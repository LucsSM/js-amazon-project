# Summary
The project is part of a free youtube course by <b>SuperSimpleDev</b>. Notes were taken before each step and worked from it as a way to not fall in "just follow the tutorial" trap.
It contains past versions of some codes and .js files because it changed throughout the course.
The project also uses Jasmine Framework for automated tests.
